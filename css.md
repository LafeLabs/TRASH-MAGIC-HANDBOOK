# TRASH MAGIC CSS

## WHAT IS CSS?

CSS SANDS FOR "CASCADED STYLE SHEETS", AND IT IS THE LANGUAGE WHICH TELLS BROWSER HOW A WEB DOCUMENT SHOULD LOOK. IT CAN BE EITHER INSERTED IN A STYLE ELEMENT OR ADDED WITH A LINK ELEMENT. 

IN TRASH MAGIC WE USE CERTAIN PIECES OF CSS CODE REPEATEDLY TO GIVE ALL THESE DOCUMENTS A CERTAIN LOOK AND FEEL!

DIRT WIZARD IS UNSKILLED WITH CSS, HOWEVER!

THIS IS VERY CRUDE CSS!

CSS CAN BE CAPS OR LOWER CASE IN MOST SITUATIONS!
