You have the power! You have the power of attention which drives the whole consumer system that is currently destroying the Earth! Our whole global system of industrial production is a vast hose sucking minerals out of the Earth and turning it into trash.  

The consumer system of media content distribution is based on two things: the private machines people view media on and the private machines that the tech companies host content on.

But what if there were a third way? What if there were digital land reform, where the serfs of our global feudal technocracy rose up and seized the digital spaces we inhabit?

How might we do that?

There are millions of perfectly functioning computers being sent to waste streams every year due to the planned obsolescense that is normalized in the tech industry.  People buy and sell working laptops by the ton. It is possible to get ahold of large quantities of computers for zero dollars with the right connections by talking to large organizations like governments and getting ahold of whoever manages their waste.  

The magic which transforms old hardware into a new digital commons which can overthrow the global tech oligarchy is in free software and self-replicating software. 

Our aim is to build "really really free" media in the anarchist tradition of Food Not Bombs and the "really really free markets". We will put free media content on free physical laptops which can distribute media over local networks and also to whoever is using the laptop. We will distribute these in public spaces for free, not as property of "consumers" but as a shared digital commons which we can use to replace *all* of Big Tech's infrastructure. 

They say the Cloud is just "other people's computers", and of course we all carry our own personal spy machine around in our pockets, full of data the corporations and states use to control us.  What I propose is that we replace the whole global system of privately owned machines with a shared network on which all money, mining and property are totally abolished.  

You have the power to make this happen!  You! The people who know how to get attention and tell stories!  I do not have this power. What I have is the tools that can be used to build this free world. I have documentation and knowhow which I can share and wish to share with all of humanity. Those tools are the free operating system called [Ubuntu Studio](https://ubuntustudio.org/), which is a free operating system built for artists and musicians, the [Apache](https://www.apache.org/) [web server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server) software, the language [PHP](https://www.php.net/), the langauges of the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)([HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS), and [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)), as well as the Trash Magic system of self-replicating code I have constructed on top of all this. 

And who am I? Why should anyone listen to me about technology and how to fix it?

I'm someone who has been around the block with technology and thinks our whole globaly system of how we make technology is fundamentally flawed. I got my PhD in applied physics and a undergrad degree in math and physics specifically to get into nanotechnology with the intention of being part of a technology revolution that never happened. My thesis work was building a new kind of thermometer for ultra low temperatures, and then I went on to work in a government lab buildng superconducting quantum amplifieres which have a range of academic uses. 

Nanotechnology contineued to fail to materialize, and eventually instead of following my plan of quitting my government lab job to start a nanotech company I quit to start a sex toy company based on applied physics principles. Our company was called "Boulder Applied Physics" also known as "X. Treme Orgasmatronics". I went by the name Dr. X Treme and wore a cape and jump suit and goggles and tried to combine applied physics with consumer technology, developing a vibrator based on some of the same physics that I had used in quantum amplifier development(impedance matching), as well as a touch sensitive strap on also based on some physics that overlapped with some of my old research intersts.  In the end, all that fell apart.  For a minute we were glorious!  We really tried to do as much of the "right thing" as possible under capitalism, paying everyone the same 36 dollars an hour including me and the other founders, giving people stock, having a generally queer friendly space that some people saw as an important part of Denver queer culture for a minute before it all fell apart. 

Without getting too much into the details of how things fell apart, I will say that my eyes were opened about capitalism after that. At the same time as I was failing in the set toy industry I was also failing at the quantum technology business, being involved in the very early phases of a startup in that space that went on to be worth vast sums of money after I said I wanted to have nothing to do with it.   The upshot of all this was that I saw a ton of things about how tech capitalism really works: how big corporations work, how military contractors work, how venture capital works, how big money NYC people work, big money West Coast porn people operate, and what society looks like when you are a "CEO". It is all bullshit! And this is not just sour grapes!  

Once I started to dig deeper into what I saw as the flaws in how tech is created and scaled, I went all the way down the rabbit hole, quitting pretty much everything and writing a manifesto about my philosophy called the [Trash Magic Manifesto and Action Coloring Book](https://lafelabs.github.io/Trash_Magic_Manifesto.pdf).  I dreamed of a world where we build absolutely everything from trash.  It was all just a fantasy, and I tried to imagine what such a world might look like.  And I built a lot of bits and pieces of the system that would eventually evolve into the one I am now presenting to the world. 

Now I see that the hard part is not actually building a world from trash. That's "just work". We have the knowhow scientifically, and with enough effort we can build anything from the trash of the old world. The hard part is getting people to believe that this is possible and deploying the actual labor to do it. It's about attention and belief!  That's the hard part!

And that, dear content creator, is why I am writing this long, somewhat poorly written letter to you!

I am asking for your help! I am asking for you to join me in seizing the digital means of production, of instituting digital land reform, and building digital global anarcho-communism!  I can teach you everything you need to know to build servers and more importantly to teach other people to build servers. Once you know how to build servers(including loading up all the content) and how to teach others to replicate the whole system, we can scale. And scale and scale and scale until there are literally billions of free web servers that exist oustide of the global system of money, property, and the imperial extraction/war machine!  

Your ability to get attention will bring power to the network. With power, we can do anything that is physically possible. And building a whole civilizaion without mining, without oil, without gas, without global imperialist extraction is absolutely physically possible.  We need only the will! 

We need to organize people to do the following:

 - gather donated hardware from our communities directly(we need people who are good at talking to large organizations and finding free stacks of laptops)
 - store hardware(find volunteers with space in garages or sheds and such who can set up some shelves for significant storage)
 - make sure all hardare is totally wiped of data and install systems and test them(we need people with basic computer skills for this, but only basic skills!)
 - organize classes(online and in person) where people can get trained in how to build servers and how to use them to distribute content
 - build content for the network, including content about how this works and how to do it and why people should help build this
 - distribute servers free in physical shared spaces like shops, parks, libraries, streets, rivers, community houses, art spaces, hacker spaces, and anywhere else where people might share anything
 - organize direct community support, where the network provides all matereial needs for content creators: EVERYTHING FREE FOR EVERYONE EVERYWHERE RIGHT NOW! 

  All content creators should be able to live well without money if we can build out a large enough social network of people who support those content creators. We aim for a system that can not only replace predatory platforms like Tiktok and Meta and Google but can allow content creators to live vastly better lives materially than is possible under capitalism.  As we scale to all of humanity, we can abolish money and property in all sectors of society by starting with free media.  
  
  We can build a free world! 
  Our media technology is powerful enough that we can use it to build any kind of world we want! I can see how the tech will fit together, but I can't do any of this without you!  Some of you will have the writing skill to vastly improve this text and make it make more sense.  
  I will leave you with the two laws of trash:
  
  1. EVERYTHING FREE FOR EVERYONE EVERYWHERE RIGHT NOW!
  2. NO ONE IS FREE UNTIL EVERYONE IS FREE!
  

LET'S BUILD THIS THING!
