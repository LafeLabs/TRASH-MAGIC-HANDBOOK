# JAVASCRIPT

JAVASCRIPT IS THE LANGUAGE WHICH DOES ACTIONS IN A WEB DOCUMENT.  WE USE JAVASCRIPT TO MAKE "APPLICATIONS" ALSO KNOWN AS "APPS" THAT CAN RUN IN A WEB BROWSER.  JAVSCRIPT IS A "C LIKE LANGUAGE" IN THAT IT LOOKS LIKE THE MUCH OLDER LANGUAGE KNOWN AS C.  JAVASCRIPT IS NOT RELATED TO JAVA.  WE CAN ADD JAVASCRIPT CODE ANYWHERE IN AN HTML DOCUMENT WITH THE "SCRIPT" TAG.  JAVASCRIPT IS ONE OF THE THREE CORE LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB, ALONG WITH [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) AND [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS).


LEARN JAVASCRIPT AND YOU CAN CREATE ANY APPLICATION YOU WANT!  JAVASCRIPT IS ALL POWERFUL!  JAVASCRIPT CAN BE USED FOR ANYTHING YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY WANT TO DO WITH MODERN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY!
