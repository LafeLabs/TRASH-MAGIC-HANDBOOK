# Markdown: The Magic Book

Markdown is the language this book is written in. It is designed to be as "lightweight" a language as possible in the sense that it tries to both be as simple as possible and also require as few added characters as possible. The main reason we use it is that it is already very widely used for documentation of technology.  It is the language of the standard "README.md" file which is ubiquitous on open source code repositories, including ALL of the Trash Magic code sets. Markdown is also now widely used in scientific computing in the Jupyter notebooks.
