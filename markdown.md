# Markdown: The Magic Book

Markdown is the language this book is written in. It is designed to be as "lightweight" a language as possible in the sense that it tries to both be as simple as possible and also require as few added characters as possible. The main reason we use it is that it is already very widely used for documentation of technology.  It is the language of the standard "README.md" file which is ubiquitous on open source code repositories, including ALL of the Trash Magic code sets. Markdown is also now widely used in scientific computing in the Jupyter notebooks.

Markdown is not always considered to be as "fundamental" a language of the World Wide Web as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but a case could be made that it is just as fundamental.  A very wide range of technology is now described for humans using this language. Without such documentation, the rest of these systems is not usable. Humans are an essential part of all human technology, and the language we use to tell other humans about what we've built is critical!

In Trash Magic, we display all documents in a web browser in HTML but write in Markdown. The way we accomplish this magic is with a FREE JavaScript Library called [Showdown.js](https://showdownjs.com/).  This critical piece of technology infrastructure which we are using to create the whole documentation media system in Trash Magic is created by one person, a medical doctor from Portugal named [Estev√£o Soares dos Santos](https://github.com/tivie).  To use this free library, we generally use the remote resource hosted for the whole of humanity at cloudflare.com by adding the following line of code to the head element of a HTML file we want to build Markdown functionality into:


```
