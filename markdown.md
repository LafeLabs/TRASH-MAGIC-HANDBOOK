# Markdown: The Magic Book

Markdown is the language this book is written in. It is designed to be as "lightweight" a language as possible in the sense that it tries to both be as simple as possible and also require as few added characters as possible. The main reason we use it is that it is already very widely used for documentation of technology.  It is the language of the standard "README.md" file which is ubiquitous on open source code repositories, including ALL of the Trash Magic code sets. Markdown is also now widely used in scientific computing in the Jupyter notebooks.

Markdown is not always considered to be as "fundamental" a language of the World Wide Web as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but a case could be made that it is just as fundamental.  A very wide range of technology is now described for humans using this language. Without such documentation, the rest of these systems is not usable. Humans are an essential part of all human technology, and the language we use to tell other humans about what we've built is critical!

In Trash Magic, we display all documents in a web browser in HTML but write in Markdown. The way we accomplish this magic is with a FREE JavaScript Library called [Showdown.js](https://showdownjs.com/).  This critical piece of technology infrastructure which we are using to create the whole documentation media system in Trash Magic is created by one person, a medical doctor from Portugal named [Estev√£o Soares dos Santos](https://github.com/tivie).  To use this free library, we generally use the remote resource hosted for the whole of humanity at cloudflare.com by adding the following line of code to the head element of a HTML file we want to build Markdown functionality into:


```
<script src = "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/showdown/1.8.6/showdown.js"></script>
```

 To load a Markdown file we begin by loading it like any other file in the Trash Magic system, by using load-file.php, which doesn't care what kind of file we are loading, as long as it's some kind of text. Once the file is loaded, if we want to display it as HTML we will create a "converter object" in Showdown and then choose a couple options as follows:
 
 ```
 var converter = new showdown.Converter();
// for more on options see here:
// https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown/wiki/Showdown-Options
converter.setOption('literalMidWordUnderscores', 'true');
converter.setOption('tables', 'true')
 ```
 
To convert a string variable called "scroll" which contains the contents of a Markdown file into HTML we use the following code:

```
rawhtml = converter.makeHtml(scroll);
```
 
And then put that HTML code into some HTML element in your document with code like this:

```
document.getElementById("scrollscroll").innerHTML = rawhtml;
```

This can be either put into a big scroll that covers the whole screen or some more specific space on the screen of the device pointed at the web page. 

Like HTML, there are really two very different things we want to do with Markdown code: display it and edit it.  The above code demonstrates using the [showdown.js](https://showdownjs.com/) library to display it, but for editing we also want to use  yet another free JavaScript library, [Ace.js](https://ace.c9.io/). This library has syntax highlighting for a large range of popular computer languages including Markdown. 

For the most part, we either edit *or* render into HTML, not both at the same time. The exception is the very useful Trash Magic app [readme.html](readme.html), which both displays and edits the README.md Markdown file that is present in all Trash Magic code sets, as well as most online open source code repositories.
