# Textile Trash Magic

100 million tons of textile production per year is all destined for global Trash Feed.  All of this waste stream has the potential to become part of the global network of self-replicating Trash Magic products!

What we want from textiles initially is to create both memes and hyperlinks. That is, we want textile products to either point to the path to replicte themseleves or to point to web pages which in turn point back to the flag. 

The language of Trash Magic textile media is based on the same four inch squares as in the [cardboard](cardboard.md) hypertext system.  Squares can be turned into a simple block mono spaced font where we remove as little as we can from each square to make a letter. Also, we apply rainbow color cycling to the letters.  

We seek out black textile waste and stitch it into square flags about a meter/yard on a side, and then stitch rainbow colored block letters onto them, then fly the black flag at the side of the road.

The flag forms a hyperlink from the physical network of streets and waterways to the virtual network of web pages in Trash Magic.  

We want flags to point to web pages which represent physical places. We buy domains for the Trash Magic network from [Easydns.com](https://easydns.com/) and get their web hosting and turn off their cyber cop nonsense to allow for editing and put trash magic on it in what we call the "Trash Cloud".  The domains are chosen for being anything but .com and for being on streets or waterways. We usually want one of each, for example if you are near some creek called clear creek, you can go find clearcreek.net or clearcreek.org or clearcreek.art or clearcreek.site or clearcreek.xyz until you find something that works.  And the same for streets, choose some major street or highway and get a domain like us-highway-36.net or something, again avoiding .com and avoiding any expensive, premium or squatted domains.

We can then fly the black flag on the physical network space and that space becomes a hybrid which blurs the lines between cyberspace and physical space.  We always post images of the flags in spaces on the physical network into the trash cloud servers hosted at the domains for that street and watershed.

The black flag is a simple and universal way to use trash combined with cutting and sewing to extend the world wide web out into the streets. These same street networks also host physical web servers which also host the digital media which are linked to from the Trash Cloud. This goes both ways: the Trash Cloud links to the Magic Dump and the Magic Dump links to the Trash Cloud.

The Black Flag is not just textiles!  It is also [JavaScript](javascript.md)! 
There is a Trash Magic App called fly-the-black-flag.html!  Make the letters, color them in and post them!

After we create and scale black flags, we turn to the Trash Magic mimetic fashion!

This is the same physical language of block letters cut from rainbow colored squares of fabric 4 inches on a side stitched onto black cloth, but applied to ALL fashion: pants, shirts, dresses, robes, capes, cloaks, sweatshirts, jackets, skirts, jump suits, kilts, socks, underwear, bags, and tents as well as all the things I forgot about here!

For clothes made from trash, the clothes are the meme! The prototype meme is FREE PANTS, which is pants found in the trash with the words FREE PANTS in trash magic rainbow cloth stitched block letters down the front and or back of the pants!

Here is an image of some free pants:
