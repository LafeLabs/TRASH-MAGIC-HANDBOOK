# FREE BOOK

This is the chapter that is entirely unique to each individual physical and virtual book. This is a open book, a free book, a book that breaks the paradigm of the exact copy. This chapter is what makes the network of physical books which flow through the world along the street and watershed networks into a social media network.  

Trash Magic is a system we must immerse ourselves in mentally and physically in order to alter the fabric of the reality we experience in our day to day lives and carry out a total revolution in the structure of everything.

To do this, we will fill in the elements here with information specific to our situation and our place in the world. Then we will evolve all these pages as the network grows, building structures that we cannot yet see or even imagine.  The nature of these elements will evolve over time.

We have both a virtual set of elements that exists in the HTML Trash Magic e-book and a physical set of elements each of which is a blank page with a caption to describe what media will go on that page.

The set represents how we "instantiate" the Trash Magic sets, being extremely specific to where we are and what we are doing and who we know and where we are going.  

ALL ELEMENTS ARE REPRESENTED IN ALL CAPS IN SIMPLE SHORT PASSAGES OF TEXT. BY DEFAULT, THERE ARE 22 ELEMENTS.  THE NATURE OF ALL ELEMENTS IS SUBJECT TO CONSTANT EVOLUTION.

 - TRASH MAGICIANS
 - TRASH MAGIC SERVER REPLICATION
 - TRASH MAGIC REVOLUTIONARIES
 - TRASH MAGIC MUSICIANS
 - TRASH MAGIC WRITERS
 - TRASH MAGIC CLOUD
 - TRASH MAGIC SOLARPUNK CYBERDECK
 - TRASH MAGIC CARTS
 - TRASH MAGIC IN THE PARK
 - TRASH MAGIC BOOK/MUSIC SHOPS
 - TRASH MAGIC STREET NETWORK
 - TRASH MAGIC WATER NETWORK
 - TRASH MAGIC BIKE/EBIKE
 - LITTLE FREE LIBRARY TRASH MAGIC DROPS
 - TRASH MAGIC ZINE LIBRARY NETWORK
 - TRASH MAGIC COLLEGE CAMPUS
 - TRASH MAGIC FLAGS
 - TRASH MAGIC STREET FEEDS
 - TRASH MAGIC WATERSHED FEEDS
 - TRASH MAGIC CONTENT FEED
 - TRASH MAGIC FASHION

The set listed above can be edited in the html version using the Trash Magic app [set.html](set.html).  The physical version is written in the book as the book moves through the network.


THE SET CAN AND WILL EVOLVE!

THEREFORE WE DO NOT EVEN LABEL OR CAPTION THE 22 BLANK PAGES!

EACH INDIVIDUAL VOLUME CAN BE IMPRINTED WITH ANY SET OF 22 ELEMENTS!

ALL THESE ELEMENTS WILL THEN BECOME SPECIFIC INSTANCES IN THE SYSTEM!
