# Global Trash Magic Revolution

The trash magic revolution is a change in the global structure of our civilization from a consumer system to a replication system.  We aim to build absolutely everything we need to live good lives across all of humanity based only on the waste streams of the consumer system and what we can grow organically.  

We start with simple reuse and repurposing such as the cardboard media and old laptops converted to Trash Magic servers. Just these simple things can lead to building hundreds of millions of servers, all outside of the consumer system, sharing freely replicating documents. This network is enough to take more and more of the power of the attention economy away from the consumer system and redirect it towards building full Trash Magic. 

With power comes the ability to do hard things that require a lot of people with specialized skills. This includes the full digital composting that is needed to build really free media. One of the core ideas of Trash Magic is that the rest of our indstry can be free if and only if our meida is really free.  If we can build self-replicating media from trash that can replicate all other things, we belive that is enough to direct our attention to all the remaining problems. 

Media is what shapes the structure of reality as we experience it. To build free media is to build freeness into the very fabric of reality! And this must be the aim of any true liberation movement. Not to merely build one or two free things, but to build a whole system of free things which can endlessly amplify and improve itself over time. 

What is digital compost?  How will we do it?  I believe this will come from several revolutionary principles of technology.  Those include building more hybrid systems which are able to combine many different types of technology from different technologies and generations into unified wholes. It will include building with the principles of Geometron, documented elsewhere, in which we focus on geometric actions rather than the numerical actions dominant in current "computers".

We must ultimately take in all the old silicon and make new silicon. And we must do this locally.  And without any new introduction of chemicals, using only the atoms that are in the old silicon. This will be very very hard! But will it be harder than what we have already built? I think not!  That was really hard! And the first time round we had to discover a ton of new science to figure it out, and were always in a huge hurry and driven by the short term profit system of venture capital backed technology startups.
