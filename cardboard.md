# CARDBOARD TRASH MAGIC

## CARDBOARD!!!!

[Cardboard!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardboard)  Humanity produces several 10's of millions of TONS of cardboard every year.  The vast majority of this ends up in the waste stream, either in a land fill or recycle.  Workers in industry who work with the material commonly known as cardboard call it "paperboard", and have insisted on having a separate wikipedia page for [paperboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paperboard).  In trash magic, we will ignore the industry nomenclature and stick to "cardboard".

Cardboard is often recycled, but fresh material is usually mixed with the product of the recycling, and the quality is lowered by injection of recycled material.

In Trash Magic, we aim for a totally circular economy. This means that we want all cardboard to be composted, rather than recycled, and used to grow rapid growth fibrous plants which can close be used to make fresh cardboard and paper products, closing the loop. We want composted cardboard to feed directly into a system of hemp production which can in turn create both cardboard and paper which can be used to print books.

But before all that, we seize the free feed of unlimited cardboard that spreads across the land and turn it into hypertext media.  This is very simple!  We simply take cardboard, cut it up, and write on it and then distribute it in shared physical spaces.

## CARDBOARD SIGNS

A cardboard sign is really just a cardboard sign.  It's simple. Take cardboard, cut it with a box cutter to get a nice flat shape, and write on it with a marker. That's it!  That's a cardboard sign!

To make a cardboard sign into hypertext, we need only write a URL on it. It's that simple. Write "WWW.TRASHROBOT.NET/CARDBOARD-SIGN/" on a piece of cardboard and now that piece of cardboard points to that URL.  So if the cardboard sign is placed in a certain physical place, that place becomes hyperlinked to that URL. 

Web pages can also have links to places!  We can post links to map urls using openstreet map or google maps and that will send someone to an exact place in the physical world. We can also easily link to physical spaces on web pages with text such as "at the little free library at the US 36 and Sheridan Park N Ride in Westminster Colorado" or "by the marker along Baseline Road on the south side, just East of Broadway in Boulder Colorado".  These simple strings of text are enough for anyone with a mobile web device to get to a physical space where they will be able to see physical cardboard which in turn links back to the Web!

When web pages link to places and places link to web pages, and it's all mediatedy by a flowing network of cardboard signs, we extend the World Wide Web out into the streets.  The whole world becomes an extension of the World Wide Web. The Web becomes physical.  And this physical extension can scale without any capital, just people doodling on trash they find around them with office supplies they already have, and making web pages for free on Trash Magic servers.

Cardboard signs can be created which represent anything. They can represent a place, a person, an idea, a product, or an action.  "Cardboard signs" are a universal framework for human communication. Cardboard signs are one of the ways that the economy of Trash Magic can start to grow outside of the old system of money and property. Anyone can create trash magic with cardboard signs to mean anything. This is much more general than money. 

Money is just a number. It carries no meaning other than "i have 10 dollars" or "i have a billion dollars" or whatever. It's just number. That's all.  Money is designed specifically to not be replicable.  That is, if I have 10 dollars and you say "having 10 dollars looks like a great idea! how can i have ten dollars?"  I can't just go make my own ten dollars that is a copy of yours. Crypto currency uses software to create money out of thin air. Software can of course be copied, and of course people have copied it, making thousands and thousands of copies of any given crypto project.  But then the whole point of money is to make it hard to copy. The purpose of the original Bitcoin project as described by its author was to solve what they called the "double spend problem", which is exactly the "copying a 10 dollar bill" described above. This contradiction between the fact that all software can be copied and the fact that making things you can't copy is the point of inventing a money system creates an unstable system which will always go through explosive bubble/crash cycles.  They try to invent their way out of this by backing the whole thing by how much energy people burn doing fake pointless math problems. 

A cardboard sign, on the other hand, can be copied billions of times for zero dollars.  And if it carries some kind of meme, that meme is also copied billions of times for free.  Nothing else in media right now quite works like that!  The feedstock for the cardboard sign global network is enough to be creating billions and billions of signs each year, indefinitely.  If we do that in conjunction with building billions of web servers from waste stream materials which can all host web content which is a virtual mirror of the street, we have a global media network that can scale to all of humanity without capital. 

Cardboard signs can be augmented with QR codes using the Trash Magic QR Code apps:

## GEOMETRON HYPERCUBE

The Geometron Hypercube is both a virtual and physical thing. The virtual thing is the data structure on which the JavaScript Geometron library is based. The physical thing is a standard design of a 4 inch cube made of cardboard. 

The cardboard cube can be used to store art supplies while we are making Trash Magic media. It can be used to store dirt and grow plants which can break out and smash and metabolize the containers and turn them into soil eventually.  Also, the GEOMETRON HYPERCUBE has a 3 inch space inside it which 3 by 5 inch cardboard cards can be stacked and stored in.  

Why a "hypercube"?  A hypercube is an extension of a cube into higher dimensions.  We imagine the set of all the cardboard cubes we make as being one vast geometric construction which spans the whole world. This construction taken as a single whole is a many dimensional constrction, since there are several(at least three) dimensions which describe the location of each cube in physical space. Thus the set of all cubes forms a kind of hyperspace, a very large space consisting of the total global state of the set of all cubes.

The Hypercube construction and the squares and cards are all described on the [HYPERCUBE github repository](https://github.com/LAfeLabs/hypercube/).


The [GEOMETRON HYPERCUBE](https://github.com/LAfeLabs/hypercube/) is constructed entirely from 4 inch cardboard squares. We therefore begin by simply making lots of those and turning them into a global network of social media. This is merely a very specific size and shape of cardboard sign, so it's an extension of the cardboard sign network described above. 

These squares are then cut into two different patterns in order to make the puzzle pieces that fit together into a cube.

For one cube, we will need five squares that we do not cut, which will form the outer panels, and 12 "side" patterns, shown below:

As well as 3 "bottom" patterns, shown below:

All the cuts are on a half inch grid, and can be marked out using Geometron and a laser cutter or using [THE UNIT, THE GREATEST RULER IN THE WORLD](https://the-unit.org/) or any other ruler in inches.  4 inches is about 10 cm, so if you are using metric you can work from there in relative scales.

Sides and bottoms are stacked 3 high to make one solid bottom and four solid sides, and then they are assembled like a puzzle as shown here:

We then apply outer panels and use markers to make them into media, and deploy them in the world as shown:

And we can use them to post up holders for 3 inch by 5 inch cards as shown here:

We also use these cubes to make robots which can print on cardboard. These robots use the stepper motors found in DVD drives for the motion and use sharpies on bits of plastic and cardboard trash to poke a piece of cardboard to draw out a pixelated icon using Geometron code. These robots are available for free from a roboticist Trash Magician if you can find one in your area who can get to a common location on public Transit.  Or you can learn to become a robot maker and start giving out your own robots!
