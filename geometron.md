# GEOMETRON

Geometron is a purely geometric programming language.  Geometron is independent of both software and hardware, and is based on the Geometron Hypercube and the Geometron Virtual Machine, both of which are abstract geometric constructions.

The Geometron Hypercube is a pair of cubes, each divided up into a set of 8x8x8 = 512 cells, each of which contains an array of addresses of cells in the Hypercube.  The Geometron Virtual Machine(GVM) is a geometric processor in the same abstract sense that a Turing Machine is a numerical processor.  The GVM carries out some geometric action for each address in the Hypercube.  The structure of the Hypercube and GVM together determine which type of action on what domain is carried out for any given address. 

All numerical computers can be shown to be equivalent to a Turing machine, which can be shown to be able to carry out any numerical computational task.

Life is not just information. Life is geometric code.  What we call "genetic information" that is encoded in RNA and DNA in living systems is all just geometric construction code. The langauge that all life is written in consists of sets of three base 4 numbers which make up a set of geometric actions which bring different amino acids into a chain that is assembled from the code.  Amino acids are themselves just simple geometric constructions of atoms which bond into stable structures when they are arranged in a certain geometric construction. 

These geometric constructions are generally made up of the same simple strucures based on the symmetries of the Universe: pentagons, hexagons, triangles, squares, tetrahedra, octahedra and so on.  

Geometron aims to create a paradigm for machine design that is more like life than the Turing machine paradigm.
