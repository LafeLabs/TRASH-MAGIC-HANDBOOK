# HTML

HTML(HyperText Markup Language) is *the* central language of the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web).  A web browser is a computer program which turns HTML into the mix of graphics and text and other media that we think of as "the web". A web server is a computer which delivers HTML files and associated files across a network to a browser. 

In Trash Magic, we also call HTML the "Hyper Trash Markup Language", because everything we do involves using trash as hypertext. When we use waste stream computers to create physical web servers which all also run web browser to look at HTML files, that is a network of hypertext documents which lives on the trash. When we write a web page address on a piece of cardboard trash, that trash becomes hypertext which links to the network of web pages which in turn link back to the physical trash.  

Hypertext is text which has links built into it which can load other documents. At this point, hypertext is so common that people don't see how revolutionary it really is.
